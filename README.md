## Overview

FlowGuard is a cutting-edge industrial control system that leverages artificial intelligence to monitor, predict, and optimize liquid flow networks in industrial environments. By combining Particle Filters for state estimation with Deep Reinforcement Learning for control optimization, FlowGuard AI provides operators with real-time insights and predictive maintenance capabilities that significantly reduce downtime and prevent catastrophic failures.

### Key Features

- **Predictive Fault Detection**: Advanced particle filtering algorithms detect potential failures before they occur with up to 95% accuracy
- **AI-Powered Control Optimization**: Deep Q-Network (DQN) agents trained on millions of simulations provide optimal control strategies
- **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**: Interactive visualization of system state with live updates and alarm management
- **Intelligent Maintenance Scheduling**: Automated repair team dispatch based on predicted failure probabilities
- **Alarm Rationalization**: Reduces alarm flooding by up to 70% through intelligent clustering and root cause analysis
- **Distributed Architecture**: Scalable microservices architecture supporting multiple concurrent operators
